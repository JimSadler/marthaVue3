    bio: 'All my life I’ve been searching for answers, even as a child. Somewhere inside of me, I knew life had more love, joy, happiness, peace, and fulfillment in store for me than I have ever allowed. While I had accomplished things in life, nothing was ever enough. I read books, meditated, investigated different religions but nothing filled my emptiness. At age 56, my life as I had known it changed. My 35 year marriage and business partnership was over. In the chaos of this, I was miraculously led to Martha Novak who presented me with the questions I needed to be asking and the new answers I needed to become considering. I have been studying with her now for almost ten years. She does not train her people lightly and I have studied hard. Two years ago, I was privileged to become one of her master healers and facilitators. I now use my experience in retail, entrepreneurship,and personal relationships to help others on their journey.',

    'What is the difference between a good coach and a great one? Being a great coach requires out-of-the-box thinking, exceptional insight and the ability to assess with neutrality. A great coach is an expert communicator who links you to your potential. It’s easy to detect bad coaches: their methods don’t lead to the power of your potential. Instead they ask you to imitate their potential.',
    'How does having a great coach benefit you? Growth is an adventure. By helping you identify and overcome personal obstacles, a great coach does more than teach you to imitate behaviors that work for most people.

      'What the LCS is: it is an assessment of how one learns and communicates. It is based on the triunal brain system, meaning that there are three parts of the brain that control three specific processes. These three centers are measured by this assessment and the information determines a series of unique learning and communication sequences that cut right to the heart of the individual and how they are performing.',
      'There are some very fine personality tests out there on the market today that give you so much information it is hard to weed through to the essentials of what you want to know about yourself and others. The LCS is different. In a few hours, you are an expert, and in those same few hours, you have the answers you\'ve been seeking about yourself, your talents, gifts and abilities, your ability to process mental, emotional and physical information, how fast you are in each of these areas, what your inclinations are and how you will be inclined to behave in any given circumstance. Employers will learn that the job they have to offer has an LCS and a successful hire is matching the right candidate\'s LCS to the job\'s LCS. This assessment can also tell an employer who\'s going to be the most productive, who can handle more stress without falling apart, who will work well with others, keep a positive attitude, and what he can expect from this employee in a crisis. This assessment shows what the individual\'s weaknesses and strengths are and how to minimize and amplify them respectively. It will enhance extremely effective communication, eliminate misunderstandings between people, deepen teamwork remarkably, lessen frustration in the workplace and much more.',

It will lead you to a new understanding of deeper realities which can actually be seen and understood, realitieswhich are hidden beneath the surface of human relationships and beneath every person\'s struggle to find meaning and happiness.',
      'The author has a unique capacity for translating complex concepts, offering practical approaches which you can immediately incorporate. She takes the stories of everyday life showing us how we trap our energies as we hold onto the past, secured to the beliefs we conjured as children, remaining energetically hostage to images and ideas that were never even ours to begin with. Only when we bring our energy into the present, do we live our lives passionately, joyously, creatively and far more lovingly according to our true nature.

Having come up empty-handed time and again, I despaired that I would ever find the answers I needed and I just gave up. Enter Martha Burgess Novak! How can I begin to describe someone who has changed my life on the deepest levels? Having worked with Martha for several months I have been transformed to my very core. She truly has a direct channel to the Divine, which is, undeniably, the source of her power. Using her incisive, intuitive abilities she cuts straight through to the heart of the issues at hand, clearing the way for deep, transformative healing on all levels. Not only does she guide you through the process of illuminating the truth of your issues but she also uses her all-reaching healing powers to insure that you have cleared that problem forever from your psyche. Her energy, love and light are totally empowering: she is Love personified! Should you be looking for proof…the unquestionable proof is that at age 71 I am the happiest I have ever been in my entire life!
